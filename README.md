  ðŸ“˜ About the Project
Have you ever wondered which movies are considered the greatest of all time? This project brings the IMDb Top 25 Movies right to your local machine, allowing you to scrape, store, and visualize movie data using Python.

Using web scraping with BeautifulSoup, we fetch the movie titles and ratings from the IMDb Top 25 chart. The data is then saved in a structured format (CSV), which makes it easy to explore, filter, or analyze later.

With Seaborn and Matplotlib, we create visualizations that help reveal patternsâ€”like which movies have the highest ratings or how tightly clustered the ratings are. This is perfect for:

ðŸŽ“ Beginners learning web scraping and data visualization

ðŸŽ¥ Movie lovers curious about IMDb trends

ðŸ“Š Data analysts looking for real-world scraping + plotting practice
